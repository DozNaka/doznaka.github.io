### DozBot
A Discord selfbot/userbot written in Python. It makes use of MongoDB so that you can change the configuration (settings) of the bot while you are using it without having to shutdown the bot and make changes to a local config file. This is very useful if you are hosting DozBot on a PaaS solution like heroku where changes will be discarded once the server restarts.

Currently the bot is in its development stage and the code is currently messy so until it is cleaned up. The source will remain closed.
